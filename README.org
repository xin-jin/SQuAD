#+TITLE: Dynamic Coattention Networks for SQuAD Question Answering System

This is a tensorflow (Python2 with Tensorflow 0.12.1) implementation of a variant of the dynamic coattention networks for the question answering system based on the SQuAD dataset. Here is the [[https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports/2762061.pdf][report]].

* Generate Answers
~qa_answer.py~ is used to generate answers from a trained model. It will take a JSON file as input and output a JSON file containing the answers. The format of JSON file can be seen in the downloaded dataset.
